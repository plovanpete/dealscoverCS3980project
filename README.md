# Dealscover
(insert gif here)
A work in progress application where you find deals near you and post them!

## Instructions to start it and load it:
For now, you'll need 3 modules: fastapi, uvicorn, and pydantic.
```
python install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```
You can then run it with this command once those three modules are installed:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
